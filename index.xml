      <description>Hi, my name is Andi, I go by 82MHz online.
Why 82MHz? Well one part comes from my year of birth, the other from the fact that I studied electrical engineering with a specialization in audio and telecommunications&amp;hellip; get it?</description>

      <description>Okay, Day 1 is almost over, what have we learned?
Modern software sucks!!
