      <description>The site is barely two months old and already the first redesign is coming.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t really warm up to the old theme, but luckily Hugo makes it really easy to change the theme.</description>

      <description>So the OCC 2023 ended almost three weeks ago and everyone went back to the year 2023 and to using their modern computers. At least I did. But let&amp;rsquo;s explore what remaind for me.</description>

      <description>So the last two days of the Old Computer Challenge went by in the blink of an eye, and not a lot has happened, so I&amp;rsquo;m putting them together in one post.</description>

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 5: Youtube Videos on an iPod Classic</title>

      <description>Note This is only semi-related to the OldComputerChallenge, but I revisited the idea of downloading videos from Youtube and putting them on an old iPod. I had already figured out the commands a while ago, but I had to refresh my memory from my bash history and because I figure this might actually be of interest to some people, I wrote it as a tutorial.</description>

How is this related to the OldComputerChallenge?

      <description>On this day I was sick, so not a lot has happened, but I would like to still briefly share a few thoughts.
I&amp;rsquo;m spending far less time aimlessly surfing the web or watching youtube-videos for hours on end, simply because it&amp;rsquo;s not very much fun.</description>

      <description>Day 2 is coming to a close. Today I was at work all day and so didn&amp;rsquo;t spend a whole lot of time on my slow computer.

      <description>Okay, Day 1 is almost over, what have we learned?
