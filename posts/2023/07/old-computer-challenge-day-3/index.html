            <p>On this day I was sick, so not a lot has happened, but I would like to still briefly share a few thoughts.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m spending far less time aimlessly surfing the web or watching youtube-videos for hours on end, simply because it&rsquo;s not very much fun. Surfing works, but most sites are not very pleasant to look at or don&rsquo;t work at all in a minimalist browser (think lynx, links2, luakit) or they slow the computer down to a crawl when using vivaldi (which is already slow thanks to its significant memory footprint). Important lesson: don&rsquo;t have more than one or two tabs open at once. Just don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>And watching youtube is pretty much impossible. Even just loading the start page takes forever, and trying to load a video&hellip; just no. I had downloaded yt-dlp beforehand to be able to download yt-videos at a lower resolution, but I would still have to get the url from somewhere and honestly, I don&rsquo;t even miss it. I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll eventually catch up on a few interesting videos that I missed during the week, but right now I&rsquo;m completely fine without spending the evening on my couch aimlessly browsing youtube.</p>
<p>A win in my opinion!</p>
<p>For fun I fired up a VM (one core slowed down, 512mb RAM of course) with Windows XP and browsed some old sites via <a href="https://theoldnet.com">the old net</a> using Retrozilla, and that turned out to be a surprising amount of fun! Retrozilla is also able to access gopher sites, and since most of the OCC-participants who run blogs keep them very minimal, starting at <a href="https://occ.deadnet.se">occ.deadnet.se</a> and looking through the blog entries listed there was no problem at all. And <strong>way</strong> faster than doing the same thing on a modern linux, despite a minimalist window manager and a lightweight browser (Midori). I even managed to install an old version of mIRC and join #oldcomputerchallenge on libera.chat, which was very surprising but pretty awesome and gave me a huge nostalgia hit :)</p>
<p>Putty still works on XP as well, so I can ssh into my &ldquo;server&rdquo; (a raspberry pi really) and do linux-y stuff on there. All in all a surprisingly nice and nostalgic experience!</p>
<p>Oh, I also switched my window manager from i3 to herbstluftwm. Why? First, I had already used herbstluftwm before and am familiar with how it works, and second, I like the name :) (for the non-German speaking world, &ldquo;Herbstluft&rdquo; means &ldquo;autumn air&rdquo;, which I think is just beautiful. Once I figure out how to post audio on here, I&rsquo;ll put a file online with the correct pronounciation ;) )</p>
