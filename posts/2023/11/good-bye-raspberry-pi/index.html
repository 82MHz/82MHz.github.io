            <p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Raspberry Pi 4 as my homeserver, it&rsquo;s running off an SD card. Or it was, because the SD card died recently, and I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>
<p>One day I woke up to the server not responding, and a reboot didn&rsquo;t help either. So I attached a monitor and found that the Pi was stuck in the &ldquo;bios&rdquo;, telling me that it couldn&rsquo;t find the SD card, even though it was plugged in.</p>
<p>So I looked at the card on my normal PC and found that it was recognized as a drive with 0 bytes. Not great.</p>
<p>I googled for a while to see if there was a way to revive the card, and I also asked on mastodon if anyone had an idea, but the responses were&hellip; not encouraging. Seems like the card is dead and at least with normal methods there is no way to restore it.</p>
<h3 id="what-happened-and-what-next">What happened, and what next?</h3>
<p>Since I can&rsquo;t look at any logs anymore, figuring out what happened is pure speculation. Someone on mastodon suggested that it might be excessive writes to the card due to the USB-stick RAID array I set up. Maybe that was the case, I don&rsquo;t know. I wasn&rsquo;t aware that a RAID can cause excessive writes to the system disk, but it could have been. Could have also been a power loss during a write and that corrupted the card&hellip;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is not the first time that&rsquo;s happened. I have a Raspi 4 at work that already killed two cards during normal operation, and there I was also not able to determine what had happened.</p>
<p>Could have been a problem with the cards, or with the Raspi, or a power failure, or a fault with the hardware that was plugged into it&hellip;</p>
<p>The problem is that I&rsquo;m starting to lose trust in Rasperry Pis, especially since there are a ton of posts online about Raspis killing SD cards&hellip; and of course I have backups and everything, so no data was lost, but setting it all up again is still a pain.</p>
<h3 id="new-server">New server</h3>
<p>I was a bit annoyed with the Raspi anyway, because I use docker a lot for the services I&rsquo;m running, and I often found that docker images weren&rsquo;t available for ARM at all or not for the specific ARM version the Pi is using, so I was already thinking about switching to x86, and this event finalized the decision.</p>
<p>My idea was to get either a SFF machine or an old laptop, so I can set up a server that consumes as little power as possible. I looked around on classified ads and found an old Dell Latitude E7440 with an i5 4200U mobile processor, 8GB RAM and 128GB SSD from a local guy, which is just about perfect for my usecase, so I bought it straight away.</p>
<p>And so here we are, an old business laptop is my new server!</p>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m in the process of setting it back up and (a first for me, but essential) documenting every step of the way in the form of a bash script that I can just run if I want to install a new server, and everything will be set up the way it was in no time. At least that&rsquo;s my goal, we&rsquo;ll see if I achieve it.</p>
