      <title>100 Days to offload</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/09/100-days-to-offload/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are things that you read or just see somewhere and you immediately think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll do that&amp;rdquo;. Some time ago I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;100 Days to offload&lt;/a&gt; challenge, and this was one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to write 100 blogposts within one year. Of course, I mentioned it right away on Mastodon that I was doing the challenge, so now I have the self-imposed task of writing 100 blogposts within one year, i.e. from today until the end of August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple, to quote from the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some simple and reasonable guidelines if you want to take part in #100DaysToOffload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This needs to be done on a personal blog, not a corporate blog. If you don’t have a personal blog, you can sign up for a free one at &lt;a href=&#34;https://bearblog.dev&#34;&gt;Bear Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no specific start date. Your 100 posts can start or end whenever you want them to, they just need to be completed within 365 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no limits to what you can post about – write about whatever interests you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have published an article, don’t forget to post a link on your social media with the hashtag &lt;code&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your friends involved!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What topics should I write about? No idea! Whatever comes to mind, probably a lot of stuff about tech, tutorials, some hobby projects I&amp;rsquo;m doing, rants about cars and lousy city design&amp;hellip; I think there are enough things to get off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I posted on Mastodon that I&amp;rsquo;m doing the challenge and was looking for fellow participants, a few people actually came forward, so here are some of my fellow participants in random order &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dustin also wants to start today (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.spotek.io/@dustin&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://0xdstn.site/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screwtape as well (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.sdf.org/@screwtape&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/tilde.institute/1/~screwtape/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matto (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pub.matto.nl/u/matto&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://box.matto.nl/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/box.matto.nl/&#34;&gt;Phlog&lt;/a&gt;) and Prahou (&lt;a href=&#34;https://merveilles.town/@prahou&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://triapul.cz/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/triapul.cz/&#34;&gt;Phlog&lt;/a&gt;) have already started last month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Noisideadlines (&lt;a href=&#34;https://writing.exchange/@noisydeadlines&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://noisydeadlines.net/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;) thought, one year is way too long, I can do it in 1/3 of the time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might now be wondering, what the &amp;hellip; is a phlog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, some people have normal http websites, but there are also the purists who use text-based protocols, either &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher&#34;&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)&#34;&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, and depending on the protocol, the pages are then called blogs (http), phlogs (gopher) or gemlogs (gemini). What do you know! I had no idea&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll limit myself to this website here for now, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add a gopher or gemini site in the future, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now to complete the confusion about all the outdated retro protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matto has set up a channel on IRC at &lt;a href=&#34;ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697&#34;&gt;libera.chat&lt;/a&gt; called #phloggersgarage, where a nice little community around blogging (phlogging&amp;hellip;) is already slowly developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s going to be exciting, interesting, challenging and I&amp;rsquo;m sure also frustrating at times over the next few months, but that&amp;rsquo;s all part of a challenge, otherwise it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a translation of the original German post made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepl.com/&#34;&gt;DeepL&lt;/a&gt; and then manually adapted to (hopefully) sound a bit more human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post the gopher pages here via http proxy. I hope the purists will forgive me, but this is the way I access the pages so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to leave the comfort of my web browser&amp;hellip;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Updated Design Part 2</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/08/updated-design-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/08/updated-design-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Who doesn&amp;rsquo;t know it: You only want to change a minor thing on the theme of the website, but you can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get it right and in the end escalate completely and rewrite the whole website from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;back-story&#34;&gt;Back story:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This website was created with &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; and originally had the theme &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/&#34;&gt;Papermod&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;, then &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-blog-awesome/&#34;&gt;Hugo Blog Awesome&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; and finally &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-theme-console/&#34;&gt;Console&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I wasn&amp;rsquo;t really happy with any of these themes, so I had already modified the Console theme quite a bit to be more like what I wanted it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, some things in the CSS were quite weirdly implemented, and no matter what I tried, some things just didn&amp;rsquo;t work out the way I wanted them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-now&#34;&gt;And now:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometime during the past week I had enough and just started to rewrite the whole site from scratch. The structure of course stays as it was before, but without all the things in the code I don&amp;rsquo;t need anyway and with a CSS that does exactly what (and only what!) I want. And with a little help from a good friend, who happens to be a web designer, I think I did a pretty good job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some things are still a bit rough and in need of improvement of course, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure there will be the occasional change here and there, but I think for now I have the site the way I like it and the way I imagined it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now the blogging can really start. More about that at the end of next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and a big sorry to those who have subscribed to my RSS feed, I&amp;rsquo;m afraid I&amp;rsquo;ve caused a bit of a mess there. I hope the time of big changes is over now and the site can stay the way it is for some time to come!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a translation of the original German post made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepl.com/&#34;&gt;DeepL&lt;/a&gt; and then manually adapted to (hopefully) sound a bit more human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge 2023 - Epilogue</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/08/old-computer-challenge-2023-epilogue/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/08/old-computer-challenge-2023-epilogue/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the OCC 2023 ended almost three weeks ago and everyone went back to the year 2023 and to using their modern computers. At least I did. But let&amp;rsquo;s explore what remaind for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to take a moment to look back and examine what was good, which tools and workflows stuck with me and what is better left back on the old computer (which was really just a VM in my case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-good&#34;&gt;The Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On both my Desktop and Laptop Computers I&amp;rsquo;m using &lt;a href=&#34;https://endeavouros.com&#34;&gt;Endeavouros&lt;/a&gt;, which is pretty much a preconfigured and nice looking Arch Linux with a few extras here and there. And because I am already familiar with it, I decided to just use this as the basis for my OCC computer as well, though with a much slimmer graphical interface (no KDE, just a &lt;a href=&#34;https://herbstluftwm.org/&#34;&gt;minimal tiling window manager&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main things I do on my private computer on a daily basis are communicating with friends, browse the web, watch videos on Youtube, listen to music, do some occasional coding and try my best not to spend too much time on social media (these days mostly Mastodon).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I lived (out of necessity of course) much more in the terminal than I usually do. I still, unfortunately communicate with friends and family via WhatsApp a lot, which I normally have open in a browser window because I hate typing on a touchscreen (if any manufacturer wants to bring back haptic keys with T9 support, I&amp;rsquo;m ready!). Like pretty much everything related to the modern web, this was more an exercise in frustration than anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since just opening a browser window filled up about half my RAM before I even opened a single website, having a bunch of tabs open at all times and flipping between them quickly turned out to be impossible. So I needed to find ways to use WhatsApp, IRC, Mastodon, Youtube, VS Code, Obsidian and a few other programs and services on a computer with limited resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there&amp;rsquo;s a surprising number of very lightweight terminal apps around for pretty much every usecase, I was surprised!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ones that stuck with me were&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/d99kris/nchat&#34;&gt;nchat&lt;/a&gt; for Whatsapp, which has a very nice ncurses interface and works beautifully (remember to install the font &lt;a href=&#34;https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Emoji&#34;&gt;noto-fonts-emoji&lt;/a&gt; if you want to see emojis instead of unicode placeholders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/RasmusLindroth/tut&#34;&gt;tut&lt;/a&gt; for Mastodon, same thing, beautiful ncurses interface, works like a charm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lynx.invisible-island.net&#34;&gt;lynx&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://links.twibright.com&#34;&gt;links2&lt;/a&gt; for web browsing in the terminal (no problem on lightweight static websites, but horrible for modern webapps bloated with js etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://irssi.org&#34;&gt;irssi&lt;/a&gt; for IRC&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rawtext.club/~sloum/bombadillo.html&#34;&gt;bombadillo&lt;/a&gt; for accessing gemini and gopher sites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And for coding, writing blog entries etc. I just used the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vim.org/&#34;&gt;best terminal editor&lt;/a&gt; ever (once you learn how to use it, that is!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I considered watching Youtube just impossible, but a few days into the OCC someone pointed me to &lt;a href=&#34;https://yewtu.be&#34;&gt;https://yewtu.be&lt;/a&gt;, where I could search for a video, get the URL, copy it to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp&#34;&gt;yt-dlp&lt;/a&gt; and just download the video in a resolution low enough to be watchable on my system. Neat!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For listening to music I used my old iPod or just turned the radio on (yes, FM radio still exists! I was surprised, too).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of these apps I actually still keep using, like nchat, tut, bombadillo and irssi, because they&amp;rsquo;re just so lightweight and easily started with a few keystrokes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say though, the most difficult thing about learning all these terminal apps was to memorize all the different key combinations! What&amp;rsquo;s just a click on the right button in a GUI turns into hunting around for which key combination does what you want to do, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that every single piece of software seems to invent its own shortcuts! Want to look at an attached media file? in tut it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;rsquo;m&amp;rsquo;, but in nchat it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;ctrl+v&amp;rsquo;. And it&amp;rsquo;s like that for everything&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s maddening! Once you&amp;rsquo;ve gotten used to it though, everything flies and is much simpler to use than clicking around in bloated graphical UIs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So everything is great, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-bad&#34;&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short: The web. Just everything about it. I already mentioned that just firing up Firefox or Vivaldi (my browser of choice for most things) uses a good chunk of RAM, and opening pretty much any website quickly fills up the rest. My system was constantly swapping, which of course slows everything down even further, and I was really glad I had an SSD, otherwise I would have had to live with the sound of a constantly whirring mechanical harddrive in my ears while slowly going insane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using text based browsers is possible, but by far not all websites load or are usable, so you often have to switch to a gui based browser and suffer. And that&amp;rsquo;s with all adblockers turned to maximum and JS disabled where possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could write a whole article about this, and maybe one day I will, but the modern web is just becoming more and more awful to use with every passing year. We&amp;rsquo;re burning gigawatthours worth of energy and are producing tons and tons of CO2 in the process just to transmit ads and self playing videos and all kinds of other crap that &lt;strong&gt;nobody even wants&lt;/strong&gt; through the net! And for what? So big corporations can get richer and richer, while the rest of us are being stripped of our privacy and the global climate is going to hell along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s never been more apparent to me than in the last few weeks: The modern web (and by extension a lot of the rest of the modern world) is a mistake. We should just hit &lt;em&gt;reset&lt;/em&gt;, go back to 1995 or so and start over, and do it better. What we&amp;rsquo;re doing right now is clearly not sustainable, nor is it healthy (not for the environment and not for our minds).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to end on this sour note, because there was also&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-great&#34;&gt;The Great&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community! Without a doubt, that was the best part of it! People were blogging about it, talking on Mastodon and IRC exchanging ideas and frustrations, giving each other support and tips&amp;hellip; it was great. &lt;strong&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; how being social online is supposed to work!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So thank you Solene for coming up with the OCC, thank you to all the participants who shared their experiences and thank you to everyone who read my posts and helped me out where necessary!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to doing this again next year :)&lt;/p&gt;
