    Using Whatsapp and other similar messengers on my phone has been making me anxious for a long time now, but I could never quite figure out exactly what the problem was. Until now.
Due to being sick, I had a lot of free time these past few days, and out of nostalgia I started playing around with setting up an ICQ server, so I could use the old ICQ clients of my youth again (only to find out that nobody I know cares about using ICQ anymore, and so the only person I can connect with is myself&hellip; but that&rsquo;s maybe a story for another day).

    I saw a post from Dustin, who saw a post from someone else, who probably saw a post from someone else about writing up which apps and services you are currently using. So let&rsquo;s jump on the hype train while it is rolling and see which apps I am using!

    <p>In October I read two non-fiction books I only recently came across, and one novel that I&rsquo;ve had for quite a while and which I wanted to read to relax, but it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be so relaxing in the end&hellip;</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Raspberry Pi 4 as my homeserver, it&rsquo;s running off an SD card. Or it was, because the SD card died recently, and I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

    <p>The other day I mentioned in passing on Mastodon that I am using two USB-Sticks as a RAID array on my homeserver, which is a Raspberry Pi 4. Much to my surprise, two people actually asked how this was done, so I promised I would write it up as a blog post. And so here we are. Let&rsquo;s have a look at how it works.</p>

    I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for a while now, and a conversation yesterday with Rogue over on Mastodon brought it to my attention again: I&rsquo;ve never been an early adopter of anything tech related. I live in the technological past. Let&rsquo;s explore if this is a good or a bad thing.

    September was not a great reading month for me. The month started with a week of being sick, during which I couldn&rsquo;t do much at all, and even after that I found it difficult to concentrate on reading. Nevertheless, I read three books (more or less), which I&rsquo;ll summarise here.

    A few days ago Whatsapp renamed the status page to &ldquo;Updates&rdquo; and introduced the &ldquo;Channels&rdquo; feature. And suddenly, the messenger I use to communicate with friends and family shows me recommendations for profiles of people and corporations I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t want to hear from.

    Around 1999, the future arrived in our home: From then on, we had internet access, and quite unusual for the time, not via modem, but via ISDN with a terrific speed of 64kBit/s! While the others were still using their ancient 56k modems, we were already surfing the information superhighway with the speed of tomorrow!

If we want to start some meaningful changes in our lives, the first step, according to Cal, is to change our peception of ourselves.

    I usually stay away from the &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; genre on YouTube as far as possible, because there are just too many influencers on there who boast about how great they are at being productive, how super sophisticated their productivity system or bullet journal is, or who produce these quite frankly ridiculous &ldquo;study with me for 13 hours&rdquo; videos.

    This is the first post of what I hope will be a monthly series in which I take a look back at the books I read the past month.
In August, I didn&rsquo;t really reach my goal of one book a week, which was partly due to the fact that I started some books and put them down again after two or three days, because I realised that they just weren&rsquo;t right for me.

    Inspired by Noisy Deadline&rsquo;s post &ldquo;Bringing back the Blogroll&rdquo; and by the blogrolls I&rsquo;ve already seen on some other sites, I wanted to set one up for myself too.
I like the concept of a blogroll, which as far as I understand is a list of blogs I like and follow (which I already have on my links page), but I thought I could do one better and create a list of all the latest posts from these blogs as well, ordered by date.

    Sometimes there are things that you read or just see somewhere and you immediately think &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cool, I&rsquo;ll do that&rdquo;. Some time ago I came across the 100 Days to offload challenge, and this was one of those things.
What is it about?
The challenge is to write 100 blogposts within one year.

    Who doesn&rsquo;t know it: You only want to change a minor thing on the theme of the website, but you can&rsquo;t seem to get it right and in the end escalate completely and rewrite the whole website from scratch.
Back story: This website was created with Hugo and originally had the theme &ldquo;Papermod&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Hugo Blog Awesome&rdquo; and finally &ldquo;Console&rdquo;.

    So the OCC 2023 ended almost three weeks ago and everyone went back to the year 2023 and to using their modern computers. At least I did. But let&rsquo;s explore what remaind for me.
I want to take a moment to look back and examine what was good, which tools and workflows stuck with me and what is better left back on the old computer (which was really just a VM in my case).
