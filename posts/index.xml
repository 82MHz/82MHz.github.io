And webpages are also so slow and bloated these days!</description>

So this year the rules for the challenge are as follows:
Let&amp;rsquo;s use a SLOW computer for 7 days. This will be achieved by various means with any hardware:
Limit your computer&amp;rsquo;s CPU to use only 1 core. This can be set in the BIOS most of the time, and on Linux you can use maxcores=1 in the boot command line, on OpenBSD you can use bsd.</description>
