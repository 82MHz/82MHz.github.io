<p>May was a slow reading month for me again, nevertheless I read three books (two and a half, really), so let&rsquo;s have a look at them.</p>
<h3 id="astrid-lindgren-ronja-räubertochter-ronja-the-robbers-daughter"><em>Astrid Lindgren</em>: Ronja Räubertochter (Ronja the Robber&rsquo;s Daughter)</h3>
<p>Every once in a while I&rsquo;m in the mood to read a children&rsquo;s book, either one that I&rsquo;ve read back when I was a kid, or one that is a classic but somehow passed me by.</p>
<p>Ronja is one of those books I never read as a child. I remember my parents dragged me to a screening of the movie once, and it scared the absolute crap out of me! Those harpies, man&hellip; I had nightmares for weeks. After this I was done with that story and never read the book or watched the movie again. Maybe I should watch it now to get over that trauma&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, it&rsquo;s a great story! There&rsquo;s a Romeo and Juliet theme throughout (without the sad ending thankfully), with the two kids from two feuding families becoming friends and overcoming the hatred that defines their father&rsquo;s relationship, but it&rsquo;s also a great coming of age story with Ronja slowly discovering that her father&rsquo;s life is not the right one for her and her finding her own way. And of course it&rsquo;s very well written with some fantastical elements strewn in (harpies!!!), so it was well worth the read and I really loved it.</p>
<p>Kids movies in the 80s though&hellip; what the hell.</p>
<h3 id="dan-abnett-planet-86"><em>Dan Abnett</em>: Planet 86</h3>
<p>A science fiction book by a british author about the colonization of a foreign planet simply called Planet 86. I found this book at a second hand store and picked it out because the story sounded really interesting. The blurb at the back of the book reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Journalist Lex Falk would do anything for a good story. When he is given the opportunity to connect to the brain of a frontline soldier via a computer chip, he is sure he has landed a major coup.<br>
But then the soldier is killed and Lex has to flee to safety&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sounds interesting enough, but I couldn&rsquo;t get into the story at all. So after a hundred pages or so I stopped reading and put the book on my &ldquo;to donate&rdquo; pile.</p>
<h3 id="joe-navarro-dangerous-personalities"><em>Joe Navarro</em>: Dangerous Personalities</h3>
<p>Joe Navarro is a former FBI investigator who specialized in reading people&rsquo;s body language and personalities. I remember reading his book &ldquo;What Every Body is Saying&rdquo; years ago and really liking it, though I don&rsquo;t remember much from it, so it might be worth rereading it at some point.</p>
<p>This one I came across while browsing through my local library and took it home because the title sounded interesting, and it didn&rsquo;t disappoint.</p>
<p>He describes a few different types of personalities (narcissists, emotionally unstable people, paranoids and people with an antisocial personality) and how they can be dangerous to you or society as a whole in the worst cases.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pop science for sure, and filtered through his lens of an FBI agent, but it&rsquo;s a fascinating dive into the personality structures of people with these kinds of disorders, and having encontered a few difficult, even toxic people myself over the course of my life, I can say that there is some good info in there.</p>
