            <p>That is not a typo in the headline, I really bought a watch for 46 (Euro)cents recently from Aliexpress. How come?</p>
<p>I am following some members of the <a href="https://oldbytes.space/tags/casiocult">#CasioCult</a> on Mastodon (fans of Casio watches for the uninitiated). They&rsquo;re regularly posting pictures of their latest acquisitions&hellip; and I got to talking to <a href="https://velocipederider.com/@ruari">Ruari</a> who posted a picture of a Casio knockoff from the Chinese brand Skmei. Never heard of them before, but I checked out the watch on Aliexpress, and it was listed for 0,46 Euro. Including shipping.</p>
<p>So I bought it. It was a total impulse purchase, but 46 Cents is literally 1/8 the price of the cup of coffee that&rsquo;s on my table right now.</p>
<p>I honestly wasn&rsquo;t even expecting to get anything, but a week and a half later it actually arrived. And I am still baffled with the economics of this whole situation&hellip; You can&rsquo;t manufacture a watch and then ship it halfway around the world for 46 cents. Somebody definitely lost money sending this thing to me. I don&rsquo;t get it.</p>
<h3 id="how-is-it">How is it?</h3>
<img class="image" src="/images/watch.jpg" style="width:50%; height:auto;"/>
<p>In short: It&rsquo;s fine for what it cost.</p>
<p>The viewing angle of the LCD is pretty bad, but overall the watch looks nice, and it shows the time, which is what a watch is supposed to do. It feels like nothing though, it&rsquo;s incredibly light and feels more like a child&rsquo;s toy than an actual watch. I actually laughed out loud when I first unboxed it (I say unboxed, but it arrived in a plastic bag, so&hellip; unbagged it?) because it felt so light and cheap and unsubstantial.</p>
<p>But it works, it looks nice, it cost basically nothing, so I have nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>Except&hellip;</p>
<h3 id="was-this-a-good-idea">Was this a good idea?</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot pretty much since the moment I clicked the order button on Aliexpress&hellip; did I really need to buy this?</p>
<p>Yes, it was only a fraction of the price of a cup of coffee, and yes, it works and it tells the time and I like how it looks. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with it from this point of view.</p>
<p>Still, I didn&rsquo;t need another watch. I have one that I&rsquo;m very happy with and that works perfectly fine. And a few things about this new one just rub me the wrong way. I don&rsquo;t know where it was manufactured, I don&rsquo;t know under which working conditions, to which environmental standards (if any), it was flown here from China (judging by how fast it arrived)&hellip;</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I bought it because it was cheap. I saw that it was only a few cents, and that price short circuited my rational thinking and I just clicked &ldquo;buy now&rdquo;. And I feel a bit of shame at the thought that I am this easily manipulated into buying a thing I didn&rsquo;t actually need, just because it was cheap. My monkey brain saw a shiny thing that was basically free and just grabbed it, and my human brain didn&rsquo;t have any say in the matter.</p>
<p>So now I have it, I will wear it occasionally and I&rsquo;m also kind of happy with it. I don&rsquo;t necessarily regret buying it, but I think I will keep it as a reminder to be a bit more mindful about my purchasing decisions in the future. Even if it&rsquo;s about something as small and ultimately insignificant as a watch.</p>
