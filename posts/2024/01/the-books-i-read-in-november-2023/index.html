            <p>I read only two books in November, and I&rsquo;m a bit late with this post, nevertheless I want to quickly summarize my thoughts about them here.</p>

<h3 id="doctorow"><em>Cory Docotorow</em>: The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation</h3>
<p>Cory Doctorow&rsquo;s latest book (at least I believe it is his latest, he releases half a dozen books a year it seems) is right up my alley, which is why I bought it immediately when it came out (and straight from his website as an ebook without any encryption or DRM, the way it should be!).</p>
<p>He laments the current state of the internet, which is largely owned and run by a handful of soulless megacorporations whose singular goal is to make as much money for themselves as possible without giving a *** about things like people&rsquo;s privacy, ethics, morals etc.</p>
<p>They do this largely by locking people into their ecosystem and once they&rsquo;re in, making it pretty much impossible to leave because the cost of switching is simply too high since for example leaving Facebook would mean losing a way to get in touch with all your contacts there. So you&rsquo;re stuck on the platform, Facebook is holding you hostage but more importantly, the users are holding themselves hostage, because you can&rsquo;t leave until everybody else leaves, so you would have to collectively agree on where to go instead, and good luck with that.</p>
<p>The solution he proposes, and the EU is actually starting to implement this this year, is interoperability: forcing the platforms to open their services to third party apps, so you can still talk to your contacts on Facebook messenger without having a Facebook account because the messenger you&rsquo;re using is interoperable with Facebook&rsquo;s messenger.</p>
<p>I am a bit sceptical that this will really end the monopolies of the big corporations, but because the EU has legislation for precisely this under way, I guess we will see what happens and if it works soon enough.</p>
<p>Regarding the book, it was well written and had a lot of great examples in it, but if you want a tl;dr of the whole topic you could just watch one of his recent conference talks instead and get a good summary of his ideas this way.</p>
<h2 id="haidt"><em>Jonathan Haidt</em>: The Happiness Hypothesis</h2>
<p>The first book by Jonathan Haidt, an American Social Psychologist, that I read was &ldquo;The Righteous Mind: Why good People are divided by Politics and Religion&rdquo;, and it was truly excellent. Still one of the best books I&rsquo;ve ever read, it explains the difference in thinking between progressive and liberal people very well.</p>
<p>This book goes in a different direction; in it he explores the question &ldquo;what makes people truly happy&rdquo; from different angles, both from a historic perspective (what does ancient wisdom and religion tell us) and from a modern scientific one (what do studies on happiness find).</p>
<p>My brain was a bit foggy when I read it, so I will definitely have to reread it at some point, but rather unsurprisingly, the things that consistently make people the most happy aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;worldly&rdquo; pleasures like money, cars, fame etc., but rather forming strong relationships with other people (both romantic relationships and family/friendships) and feeling a sense of purpose by doing something for others like volunteering in your community, teaching, helping people etc.</p>
<p>In the end, the wisdom in the book isn&rsquo;t groundbreaking, but it is very well written and gives a very concise and positive answer to the question &ldquo;what will make me truly happy&rdquo;. Highly recommended.</p>
