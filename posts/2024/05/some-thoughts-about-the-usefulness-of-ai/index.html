            <p>AI is all the rage now, but like most people in my tiny little tech-bubble on the internet, I&rsquo;m fairly critical of it. And the recent onslaught of news doesn&rsquo;t really help to change this, there&rsquo;s everything from <a href="https://www.rabbit.tech/">hilariously terrible products</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/20/technology/scarlett-johannson-openai-voice.html">totally not using Scarlett Johanssons voice</a> to <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o">telling you to put glue on your pizza</a>. At least they&rsquo;re doing their best to keep us entertained.</p>

<p>Still, I&rsquo;m a software developer in my day job, so I am curious about how that&rsquo;s going to affect my work and my profession in the future.</p>
<p>So reluctantly this week I created an account for ChatGPT, to see for myself what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>And then I sat in front of that white website and thought &ldquo;now what&rdquo;?</p>
<p><strong>A simple script</strong></p>
<p>Well I wanted to see how I could use it as a software developer. One thing I do is occasionally write scripts in bash or python to do some simple tasks for me.</p>
<p>I started writing these linkdump posts a few weeks ago, and a recurring thing I do for these is to format the links (in markdown) like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>**[Example Domain](https://www.example.com)**
</code></pre><p>This produces a link that looks like this: <strong><a href="https://www.example.com">Example Domain</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s a bit tedious creating this, because I have to open the website, copy the title, paste it to my document, paste the URL, add the asterisks and the brackets&hellip; So I asked ChatGPT to create a bash script that takes a URL as a parameter, calls the website, downloads the title, formats it like I want it and copies everything to the clipboard.</p>
<p>And it came back with a script that does exactly this. Even has a little help text that tells me how to use the script if I call it without a parameter&hellip; It&rsquo;s impressive. And it worked first try, no bug fixing necessary.</p>
<p>Now I could have written this script myself, but I&rsquo;m not a bash wizard, so I would have had to google a few things (how to get the title of a website, how to paste from bash to the clipboard) and probably fix a few bugs I made along the way, so it would have taken me maybe 10 or 15 minutes to write this. ChatGPT did it in a few seconds. The longest bit was actually writing the prompt.</p>

<p><strong>Explain like I&rsquo;m five</strong></p>
<p>I came across a particularly convoluted and complicated call to &lsquo;sed&rsquo; in a script this week, and I thought I&rsquo;d see what ChatGPT had to say about it, so I just pasted the call into ChatGPT and asked it to explain it to me, and it did a great job explaining every part of the call, even mentioned that that was a bit of an unusual syntax for sed but why it might have been done this way. This really helped me to understand the call a lot quicker than I would have otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>A simple note taking/diary website written in Go</strong></p>
<p>For my own personal thoughts, kind of like an online diary, I tried creating a website a while ago that kind of looks and functions like <a href="https://www.usememos.com/">Memos</a>, but way simpler and reduced to the bare minimum of features I need.</p>
<p>I had the idea a while ago of writing it in either PHP or Go, but I don&rsquo;t know either programming language very well, so after a while I gave up and decided to come back to the project at a later date, which I then never did. So I wanted to see how ChatGPT dealt with this.</p>
<p>This was not done with one single prompt thought, but many different iterations of me saying &ldquo;add a CSS to make it prettier&rdquo;, &ldquo;sort the entries in reverse chronological order&rdquo; etc.</p>
<p>But every time ChatGPT came back with changes to the program, told me how to compile it and where to store the files and how to run it. I didn&rsquo;t write a single line of code and in about half an hour had a program that did pretty much exactly what I wanted, and was written in a language I don&rsquo;t even know. It&rsquo;s not perfect, but it&rsquo;s a good starting point to refine it further, with or without the help of AI.</p>

<p><strong>Pong</strong></p>
<p>For fun I just told it to write me a simple Pong game in C with the SDL library. Again, it came out with C code that is working perfectly fine and can be played by two players who control both the paddles. Maybe that code is 100% copied from somewhere, I don&rsquo;t know, but it works out of the box, and came with instructions on how to compile it and which libraries to install, which is impressive.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, am I converted? Am I an AI fanboy now? Is Sam Altman my new idol?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But I recognize that AI is a tool that <em>can</em> be helpful, <em>if</em> you know how to use it correctly and you are aware of its dangers and limitations. Then it can actually be a great help and a time saver, with some caveats I&rsquo;ll get to.</p>
<p>As an example, I could imagine a (local and offline) installation of a LLM (large language model) at work that has access to the entire codebase and all the existing documentation of a project could be tremendously useful, especially for new hires. Wrapping your head around an existing codebase is always very difficult, as often things have grown for a number of years and aren&rsquo;t always implemented/connected in the most logical way possible, and documentation is also often outdated or even non-existent. So new hires always have to ask a ton of questions, and even I after working in the same company for 1,5 years find myself regularly asking colleagues to explain parts of the system to me that I have not had to deal with previously.</p>
<p>An AI that has the overview and the knowledge of the entire system could be very helpful in cases like these. It would be one more tool of many, and if you know what to expect from it, what the limitations are and that you always have to cross check the output it gives you because it might not be correct, it could be a great help.</p>
<p>The problem is that most people will not use AI like this. They will ask it things and then run off with whatever the AI gives them as an answer. And that is highly dangerous. We&rsquo;ve seen how terrible and dangerous social media is for society, and we have no idea what AI is going to do when it will be integrated in every browser and every OS and every new smartphone in a few years (or months).</p>
<p>Zuckerberg still thinks Facebook is a great system and a benefit for society, despite a <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/09/myanmar-facebooks-systems-promoted-violence-against-rohingya-meta-owes-reparations-new-report/">growing mountain of evidence</a> to the contrary. And I see the same thing in Sam Altman. I don&rsquo;t believe a word when he says he&rsquo;s worried about the impact his product could have on society or humanity. The only thing he&rsquo;s worried about is losing out to the competition and the money of the investors going to some other company instead of his. Everything else is taking a back seat behind this.</p>
<p>AI is a tool, and a powerful and dangerous one at that. And just like we wouldn&rsquo;t hand a chainsaw to a child or a person not fit for and trained in handling it, we shouldn&rsquo;t just make such tools available to anyone without the proper training and qualification to handle them in a responsible and safe way.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing about creating these code examples with ChatGPT: It was interesting, fascinating even to watch as the code appeard on screen, and it was fast and the output worked exactly as expected, at least for my admittedly very simple usecases.</p>
<p>But I didn&rsquo;t learn anything. I didn&rsquo;t have to use my brain and think about how I would have solved the problem at hand. I just typed the problem into a website, got some code back, ran it and was happy when it did what I wanted it to do. It felt a bit like taking an elevator instead of walking a few flights of stairs, or driving somewhere instead of walking or cycling. Yes it was fast, yes it was convenient&hellip; but it didn&rsquo;t exercise my mental muscles at all.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure this is a topic I will pick up again in the future, but I think for now that post is long enough.</p>
<p>So what are your thoughts on AI? Does it have its uses like it does for me, or does the bad outweigh the good? To be honest I&rsquo;m still not sure, so I&rsquo;d love to hear your opinion!</p>
