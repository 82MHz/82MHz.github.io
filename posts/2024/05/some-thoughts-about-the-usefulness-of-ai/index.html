            <p>AI is all the rage now, but like most people in my tiny little tech-bubble on the internet, I&rsquo;m fairly critical of it. And the recent onslaught of news about it doesn&rsquo;t really help to change this, there&rsquo;s everything from hilariously terrible products, totally not Scarlett Johanssons voice to telling you to put glue on your pizza. At least they&rsquo;re doing their best to keep us entertained.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>Still, I&rsquo;m a software developer in my day job, so I am curious about how that&rsquo;s going to affect my work and my profession in the future.</p>
<p>So reluctantly this week I created an account for ChatGPT, to see for myself what all the fuss was about.</p>
<p>And then I sat in front of that white website and thought &ldquo;now what&rdquo;?</p>
<p><strong>A simple script</strong></p>
<p>Well I wanted to see how I could use it as a software developer. One thing I do is occasionally write scripts in bash or python to do some simple tasks for me.</p>
<p>I started writing these linkdump posts a few weeks ago, and a recurring thing I do for these is to format the links (in markdown) like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>**[Example Domain](https://www.example.com)**
</code></pre><p>This produces a link that looks like this: <strong><a href="https://www.example.com">Example Domain</a></strong>. It&rsquo;s a bit tedious creating this, because I have to open the website, copy the title, paste it to my document, paste the URL, add the asterisks and the brackets&hellip; So I asked ChatGPT to create a bash script that takes a URL as a parameter, calls the website, downloads the title, formats it like I want it and copies everything to the clipboard.</p>
<p>And it came back with a script that does exactly this. Even has a little help text that tells me how to use the script if I call it without a parameter&hellip; It&rsquo;s impressive. And it worked first try, no bug fixing necessary.</p>
<p>Now I could have written this script myself, but I&rsquo;m not a bash wizard, so I would have had to google a few things (how to get the title of a website, how to paste from bash to the clipboard) and probably fix a few bugs I made along the way, so it would have taken me maybe 10 or 15 minutes to write this. ChatGPT did it in a few seconds. The longest bit was actually writing the prompt.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>So, am I an AI fanboy now?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>But I recognize that AI is a tool that <em>can</em> be helpful, <em>if</em> you know how to use it correctly and you are aware of its dangers and limitations. Then it can actually be a great help and a time saver.</p>
<p>The problem is that most people will not use it like this. They will ask it things and then run off with whatever the AI gives them as an answer</p>
