            <p>It&rsquo;s time again to take a quick look at the books I read in April 2024.
<img class="image" src="/images/booksapril2024.png" max-height="200x"/></p>
<h3 id="brian-moran-michael-lennington-the-12-week-year"><em>Brian Moran, Michael Lennington</em>: The 12 Week Year</h3>
<p>A book with a very clickbaity title, but actually a message that resonates a lot with me. Their general idea is to &ldquo;redefine&rdquo; a year as having only 12 weeks, and then only planning out this 12 week year instead of the whole calendar year. The reason behind this is that a year is a long time and planning a full year in advance is very difficult (in January you have no idea what how December will look like) and it also leads to procrastination (a year is long, I have enough time to get started).</p>
<p>If you make your plans (both personal and professional) only for the next 12 weeks, that&rsquo;s a much shorter timeframe to oversee, so you can plan more precisely, and there&rsquo;s also some urgency involved (I only have 12 weeks), so that hopefully reduces some of the procrastination.</p>
<p>And then there&rsquo;s a lot of guidance in the book about developing your vision for your life, and how to devise your long term and short term plans from this.</p>
<p>I personally found this very useful advice and will incorporate this 12 week planning into my life (I won&rsquo;t call it a 12 week &ldquo;year&rdquo; though ;) ).</p>
<h3 id="noah-kagan-million-dollar-weekend"><em>Noah Kagan</em>: Million Dollar Weekend</h3>
<p>Another title that sounds like pure clickbait, but I enjoyed reading a lot. Noah Kagan walks thorugh his method of creating a business from the ground up without bankrupting yourself or sinking endless amounts of time and money into creating a product that after completion turns out nobody actually wants.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t plan on creating my own business any time soon (if ever), but reading this takes away at least some of the anxiety I feet when I even just think about selling a product or service or marketing myself. And for that alone, this is well worth the read.</p>
<h3 id="kara-swisher-burn-book"><em>Kara Swisher</em>: Burn Book</h3>
<p>This was a good one! Kara Swisher is a tech journalist with decades worth of experience in the industry at this point, and these are her memoires where she looks back on her life, especially her professional life of course and her encounters with the big names in the tech world (Jobs, Musk, Zuckerberg, Bezos etc.).</p>
<p>The core of the book is a chapter on each of those people, how their relationship or lack thereof developed and changed over time, and her feelings towards them, be it admiration (Jobs), disappointment (Musk) or almost horror (Zuckerberg).</p>
<p>My favourite quote from the book is about Mark Zuckerberg:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No, Zuckerberg wasn’t an asshole. He was worse. He was one of the most carelessly dangerous men in the history of technology who didn’t even know it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="aaron-swartz-the-boy-who-could-change-the-world"><em>Aaron Swartz</em>: The Boy who could change the World</h3>
<p>This is a collection of essays that the late Aaron Swartz published on his blog during his years as an activist.</p>
<p>Aaron Swartz, if you don&rsquo;t know him, came of age during the 90s when the internet was still in its infancy and quickly developed a reputation as a hacker and web activist (he was involved in the development of the RSS standard, among other things). He was very active as an activist for free speech and open access to information, working for Wikipedia and also being involved in Wikileaks, which (among other things) put him at odds with the US authorities.</p>
<p>The book categorizes his writings by different topics. I must admit I didn&rsquo;t read every word, but I skipped around and read a few of his articles in every chapter, and it gave me a good sense of who he was and what his philosophy and his political attitude was.</p>
<p>I talk about him in the past because in the early 2010s he came under a lot of legal pressure and was facing a prison sentence, and the prospect of this caused him to end his life in 2013 at the age of 26.</p>
<h3 id="em-forster-the-machine-stops"><em>E.M. Forster</em>: The Machine Stops</h3>
<p>This is more of a novella or a short story than a full sized novel, but it was a great read nonetheless. It&rsquo;s over a hundred years old at this point, but it feels surprisingly modern. It&rsquo;s set in a dystopian future where every person&rsquo;s life is controlled by &ldquo;The Machine&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I could write more about it, but I discovered it over on <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/">Joel&rsquo;s site</a>, who wrote <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/the-machine-stops/">a very good review</a> about it, so I would invite you to go over there and read his review instead because he gives a pretty nice summary of it and also talks about how modern and relevant the story feels today.</p>
