    I recently got an old Compaq Evo 410c Laptop from 2001, which is actually a very nice laptop for the time, but it is suffering from the same problem all old laptops are suffering from: its battery died a long time ago. So I started thinking about what to do about this.<br/>

    I think we’re fast approaching a world where it doesn’t matter in what language you post your content (blog posts, Youtube videos etc.) in, because everything can just be translated on the fly into every other (major) language in reasonable quality.

    Last year I wrote an article titled “Living in the (technological) past”, in which I talked about my approach to buying, or rather refusing to buy, new electronic devices. If you haven’t read it or don’t remember it, don’t worry - I asked an AI to summarize it, so you can get up to speed quickly:

    Recently I came across a Post by Kev Quirk where he talks about how he uses a service called “Echo Feed” to cross post his blog posts to Mastodon. I had thought about implementing something like this too for a while, and this gave me the motivation to look into it again.

    That is not a typo in the headline, I really bought a watch for 46 (Euro)cents recently from Aliexpress. How come?

    I realize I haven’t written any book reviews this year so far, even though I’ve been reading constantly, but more slowly than in the past. So in order to catch up I’ll just summarize the books I read so far this year here, and I’ll try my best to be brief and not ramble on forever like I normally do.<br/>

    The world seems to be going mad recently, with wars breaking out left and right, so for the past couple of weeks I’ve been thinking a lot about my long held pacifist beliefs and if they’re still applicable in 2024. Content warning obviously, this is political.<br/>
