    September was not a great reading month for me. The month started with a week of being sick, during which I couldn&rsquo;t do much at all, and even after that I found it difficult to concentrate on reading. Nevertheless, I read three books (more or less), which I&rsquo;ll summarise here.

    A few days ago Whatsapp renamed the status page to &ldquo;Updates&rdquo; and introduced the &ldquo;Channels&rdquo; feature. And suddenly, the messenger I use to communicate with friends and family shows me recommendations for profiles of people and corporations I don&rsquo;t know and don&rsquo;t want to hear from.

    Around 1999, the future arrived in our home: From then on, we had internet access, and quite unusual for the time, not via modem, but via ISDN with a terrific speed of 64kBit/s! While the others were still using their ancient 56k modems, we were already surfing the information superhighway with the speed of tomorrow!

    In the last post I introduced Cal Newport&rsquo;s &ldquo;Deep Life Stack&rdquo;, his program to put your life on a more solid foundation. Today I want to expand on this and have a look at the fist layer, &ldquo;discipline&rdquo;.
If we want to start some meaningful changes in our lives, the first step, according to Cal, is to change our peception of ourselves.

    I usually stay away from the &ldquo;productivity&rdquo; genre on YouTube as far as possible, because there are just too many influencers on there who boast about how great they are at being productive, how super sophisticated their productivity system or bullet journal is, or who produce these quite frankly ridiculous &ldquo;study with me for 13 hours&rdquo; videos.

    This is the first post of what I hope will be a monthly series in which I take a look back at the books I read the past month.
In August, I didn&rsquo;t really reach my goal of one book a week, which was partly due to the fact that I started some books and put them down again after two or three days, because I realised that they just weren&rsquo;t right for me.

    Inspired by Noisy Deadline&rsquo;s post &ldquo;Bringing back the Blogroll&rdquo; and by the blogrolls I&rsquo;ve already seen on some other sites, I wanted to set one up for myself too.
I like the concept of a blogroll, which as far as I understand is a list of blogs I like and follow (which I already have on my links page), but I thought I could do one better and create a list of all the latest posts from these blogs as well, ordered by date.

    Sometimes there are things that you read or just see somewhere and you immediately think &ldquo;that&rsquo;s cool, I&rsquo;ll do that&rdquo;. Some time ago I came across the 100 Days to offload challenge, and this was one of those things.
What is it about?
The challenge is to write 100 blogposts within one year.

    Who doesn&rsquo;t know it: You only want to change a minor thing on the theme of the website, but you can&rsquo;t seem to get it right and in the end escalate completely and rewrite the whole website from scratch.
Back story: This website was created with Hugo and originally had the theme &ldquo;Papermod&rdquo;, then &ldquo;Hugo Blog Awesome&rdquo; and finally &ldquo;Console&rdquo;.

    Just a little announcement today, I have added two new sections to the website: Links and Bookclub.
Links should be pretty self-explanatory, on this page I collect links to interesting blogs, articles, documents&hellip;. everything I find interesting or worth knowing and want to share or remember for later.

    The site is barely two months old and already the first redesign is coming.
I didn&rsquo;t really warm up to the old theme, but luckily Hugo makes it really easy to change the theme. Of course, you&rsquo;re still going to spend days tinkering to get everything exactly the way you want it, and it&rsquo;s still not exactly the way I want it, but that will come in time.

    So the OCC 2023 ended almost three weeks ago and everyone went back to the year 2023 and to using their modern computers. At least I did. But let&rsquo;s explore what remaind for me.
I want to take a moment to look back and examine what was good, which tools and workflows stuck with me and what is better left back on the old computer (which was really just a VM in my case).

    So the last two days of the Old Computer Challenge went by in the blink of an eye, and not a lot has happened, so I&rsquo;m putting them together in one post. But I still wanted to note a few things down, and I might also a wrap-up some time next week.

    Note This is only semi-related to the OldComputerChallenge, but I revisited the idea of downloading videos from Youtube and putting them on an old iPod. I had already figured out the commands a while ago, but I had to refresh my memory from my bash history and because I figure this might actually be of interest to some people, I wrote it as a tutorial.

    I want to take this post to get out some thoughts about the internet, social media and mental health.
How is this related to the OldComputerChallenge?
Let&rsquo;s take a look.
For the longest time now I didn&rsquo;t have a facebook profile, and I never had a twitter profile or a tiktok account or a profile on any of the new social media platforms that are en vogue these days.

    On this day I was sick, so not a lot has happened, but I would like to still briefly share a few thoughts.
I&rsquo;m spending far less time aimlessly surfing the web or watching youtube-videos for hours on end, simply because it&rsquo;s not very much fun.

    Day 2 is coming to a close. Today I was at work all day and so didn&rsquo;t spend a whole lot of time on my slow computer.
However, A thought occurred to me recently, because since I subscribed to mastodon a couple of weeks ago and especially since I started following some retro computing related postings (where I discoved the OCC in the first place), I discovered that there&rsquo;s a thing called

    Okay, Day 1 is almost over, what have we learned?
Modern software sucks!!
I mean, it doesn&rsquo;t really, a lot of it is quite beautiful and easy to use, but boy, everything consumes so many resources! Just starting up a web browser (firefox or chrome doesn&rsquo;t really matter) takes a good ten seconds or more, and then we haven&rsquo;t even loaded a single page yet.

So this year the rules for the challenge are as follows:
Let&rsquo;s use a SLOW computer for 7 days. This will be achieved by various means with any hardware:
