                    Using Whatsapp and other similar messengers on my phone has been making me anxious for a long time now, but I could never quite figure out exactly what the problem was. Until now.
Due to being sick, I had a lot of free time these past few days, and out of nostalgia I started playing around with setting up an ICQ server, so I could use the old ICQ clients of my youth again (only to find out that nobody I know cares about using ICQ anymore, and so the only person I can connect with is myself&hellip; but that&rsquo;s maybe a story for another day).

                    I saw a post from Dustin, who saw a post from someone else, who probably saw a post from someone else about writing up which apps and services you are currently using. So let&rsquo;s jump on the hype train while it is rolling and see which apps I am using!

                    <p>In October I read two non-fiction books I only recently came across, and one novel that I&rsquo;ve had for quite a while and which I wanted to read to relax, but it didn&rsquo;t turn out to be so relaxing in the end&hellip;</p>

                    <p>I&rsquo;ve been using a Raspberry Pi 4 as my homeserver, it&rsquo;s running off an SD card. Or it was, because the SD card died recently, and I don&rsquo;t know why.</p>

                    <p>The other day I mentioned in passing on Mastodon that I am using two USB-Sticks as a RAID array on my homeserver, which is a Raspberry Pi 4. Much to my surprise, two people actually asked how this was done, so I promised I would write it up as a blog post. And so here we are. Let&rsquo;s have a look at how it works.</p>
