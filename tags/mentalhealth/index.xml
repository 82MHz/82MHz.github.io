      <description>I want to take this post to get out some thoughts about the internet, social media and mental health.
How is this related to the OldComputerChallenge?
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.
For the longest time now I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a facebook profile, and I never had a twitter profile or a tiktok account or a profile on any of the new social media platforms that are en vogue these days. The only social media I had left was Instagram, but I stopped using it a few months ago because I realized I was just mindlessly scrolling through posts for hours on end without getting much value or enjoyment out of it at all.</description>
