      <title>100 Days to offload</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes there are things that you read or just see somewhere and you immediately think &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s cool, I&amp;rsquo;ll do that&amp;rdquo;. Some time ago I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;100 Days to offload&lt;/a&gt; challenge, and this was one of those things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is it about?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenge is to write 100 blogposts within one year. Of course, I mentioned it right away on Mastodon that I was doing the challenge, so now I have the self-imposed task of writing 100 blogposts within one year, i.e. from today until the end of August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rules are simple, to quote from the website:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some simple and reasonable guidelines if you want to take part in #100DaysToOffload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This needs to be done on a personal blog, not a corporate blog. If you don’t have a personal blog, you can sign up for a free one at &lt;a href=&#34;https://bearblog.dev&#34;&gt;Bear Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no specific start date. Your 100 posts can start or end whenever you want them to, they just need to be completed within 365 days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publish 100 new posts in the space of a year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are no limits to what you can post about – write about whatever interests you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Once you have published an article, don’t forget to post a link on your social media with the hashtag &lt;code&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get your friends involved!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What topics should I write about? No idea! Whatever comes to mind, probably a lot of stuff about tech, tutorials, some hobby projects I&amp;rsquo;m doing, rants about cars and lousy city design&amp;hellip; I think there are enough things to get off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After I posted on Mastodon that I&amp;rsquo;m doing the challenge and was looking for fellow participants, a few people actually came forward, so here are some of my fellow participants in random order &lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dustin also wants to start today (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.spotek.io/@dustin&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://0xdstn.site/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Screwtape as well (&lt;a href=&#34;https://mastodon.sdf.org/@screwtape&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/tilde.institute/1/~screwtape/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Matto (&lt;a href=&#34;https://pub.matto.nl/u/matto&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://box.matto.nl/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/box.matto.nl/&#34;&gt;Phlog&lt;/a&gt;) and Prahou (&lt;a href=&#34;https://merveilles.town/@prahou&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://triapul.cz/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://portal.mozz.us/gopher/triapul.cz/&#34;&gt;Phlog&lt;/a&gt;) have already started last month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And Noisideadlines (&lt;a href=&#34;https://writing.exchange/@noisydeadlines&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://noisydeadlines.net/&#34;&gt;Blog&lt;/a&gt;) thought, one year is way too long, I can do it in 1/3 of the time!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might now be wondering, what the &amp;hellip; is a phlog?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, some people have normal http websites, but there are also the purists who use text-based protocols, either &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher&#34;&gt;Gopher&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)&#34;&gt;Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, and depending on the protocol, the pages are then called blogs (http), phlogs (gopher) or gemlogs (gemini). What do you know! I had no idea&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll limit myself to this website here for now, but maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll add a gopher or gemini site in the future, we&amp;rsquo;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And now to complete the confusion about all the outdated retro protocols:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matto has set up a channel on IRC at &lt;a href=&#34;ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697&#34;&gt;libera.chat&lt;/a&gt; called #phloggersgarage, where a nice little community around blogging (phlogging&amp;hellip;) is already slowly developing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;rsquo;s going to be exciting, interesting, challenging and I&amp;rsquo;m sure also frustrating at times over the next few months, but that&amp;rsquo;s all part of a challenge, otherwise it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a challenge!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a translation of the original German post made by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.deepl.com/&#34;&gt;DeepL&lt;/a&gt; and then manually adapted to (hopefully) sound a bit more human&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;footnotes&#34; role=&#34;doc-endnotes&#34;&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id=&#34;fn:1&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I post the gopher pages here via http proxy. I hope the purists will forgive me, but this is the way I access the pages so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to leave the comfort of my web browser&amp;hellip;.&amp;#160;&lt;a href=&#34;#fnref:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-backref&#34; role=&#34;doc-backlink&#34;&gt;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 3</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:50:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this day I was sick, so not a lot has happened, but I would like to still briefly share a few thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m spending far less time aimlessly surfing the web or watching youtube-videos for hours on end, simply because it&amp;rsquo;s not very much fun. Surfing works, but most sites are not very pleasant to look at or don&amp;rsquo;t work at all in a minimalist browser (think lynx, links2, luakit) or they slow the computer down to a crawl when using vivaldi (which is already slow thanks to its significant memory footprint). Important lesson: don&amp;rsquo;t have more than one or two tabs open at once. Just don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And watching youtube is pretty much impossible. Even just loading the start page takes forever, and trying to load a video&amp;hellip; just no. I had downloaded yt-dlp beforehand to be able to download yt-videos at a lower resolution, but I would still have to get the url from somewhere and honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t even miss it. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually catch up on a few interesting videos that I missed during the week, but right now I&amp;rsquo;m completely fine without spending the evening on my couch aimlessly browsing youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A win in my opinion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun I fired up a VM (one core slowed down, 512mb RAM of course) with Windows XP and browsed some old sites via &lt;a href=&#34;https://theoldnet.com&#34;&gt;the old net&lt;/a&gt; using Retrozilla, and that turned out to be a surprising amount of fun! Retrozilla is also able to access gopher sites, and since most of the OCC-participants who run blogs keep them very minimal, starting at &lt;a href=&#34;https://occ.deadnet.se&#34;&gt;occ.deadnet.se&lt;/a&gt; and looking through the blog entries listed there was no problem at all. And &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; faster than doing the same thing on a modern linux, despite a minimalist window manager and a lightweight browser (Midori). I even managed to install an old version of mIRC and join #oldcomputerchallenge on libera.chat, which was very surprising but pretty awesome and gave me a huge nostalgia hit :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putty still works on XP as well, so I can ssh into my &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; (a raspberry pi really) and do linux-y stuff on there. All in all a surprisingly nice and nostalgic experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I also switched my window manager from i3 to herbstluftwm. Why? First, I had already used herbstluftwm before and am familiar with how it works, and second, I like the name :) (for the non-German speaking world, &amp;ldquo;Herbstluft&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;autumn air&amp;rdquo;, which I think is just beautiful. Once I figure out how to post audio on here, I&amp;rsquo;ll put a file online with the correct pronounciation ;) )&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 2</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 18:00:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 2 is coming to a close. Today I was at work all day and so didn&amp;rsquo;t spend a whole lot of time on my slow computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, A thought occurred to me recently, because since I subscribed to mastodon a couple of weeks ago and especially since I started following some retro computing related postings (where I discoved the OCC in the first place), I discovered that there&amp;rsquo;s a thing called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://communitywiki.org/static/SmolNet.html&#34;&gt;The SmolNet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it? Well, according to the link above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “smol” net is the “small” net. It’s small because it is build for friends and friends of friends. It doesn’t have to scale to millions of people because those millions should build their own local small nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this help explaining it? No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re in or approaching middle age right now, you probably remember the internet of the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re too young for that, this might sound like grandpa telling stories about the war, but there was a time when the internet was young and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet entirely run by a handful of gigantic evil megacorporations (Amazon, Google, Facebook&amp;hellip;). Back then, people used to meet and chat on forums or IRC or BBSes (bulletin boards, but that was even before my time), and they would code their own personal websites and build communities and exchange their thoughts and ideas in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the web 2.0 with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram etc., which opened the web up to the masses, but it also ushered in an era where everyone was on the same few platforms and where everyone&amp;rsquo;s profile looks like everyone elses because that was what the platform dictated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;strong&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; was introduced and turned the internet into a miserable and dystopian hellscape filled with online bullying and hatred and outrage because that&amp;rsquo;s what gets peoples attention and is good for the bank accounts of the Zuckerbergs and Dorseys and Musks of the world, but bad for essentially the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;re still at today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between the cracks of this modern, corporatized, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&#34;&gt;enshittified&lt;/a&gt; internet where everything looks the same and everyone is out to get your data and track you and bombard you with ads there is a small world where the internet of old still (or again?) exists. Where people build small websites, talk on IRC or BBSes, and use old protocols like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)&#34;&gt;gopher&lt;/a&gt; (or modernized versions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)&#34;&gt;gemini&lt;/a&gt;) and exchange information in this way, far away from the walled gardens of Facebook, Twitter and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like it was when the internet was new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet of old is still alive today. You just have to look in the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think this is beautiful, and it makes me happy, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s explore it some more on day 3 :)&lt;/p&gt;
