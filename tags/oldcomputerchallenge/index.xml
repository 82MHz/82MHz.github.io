      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Days 6 and 7</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-days-6-and-7/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 07:29:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-days-6-and-7/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So the last two days of the Old Computer Challenge went by in the blink of an eye, and not a lot has happened, so I&amp;rsquo;m putting them together in one post. But I still wanted to note a few things down, and I might also a wrap-up some time next week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-6&#34;&gt;Day 6&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was boiling hot outside (35Â°C) and I am just completely useless in these kinds of temperatures (in Germany we also don&amp;rsquo;t tend to have AC, so no way to cool my apartment down). So I was just lying around most of the day, trying to move as little as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the evening it cooled down and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d explore the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; site of the internet some more, this time in the form of looking at Bulletin Board Systems (BBS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now these are definitely a product and technology of the 80s, and I am too young to have experienced them in their time (in the 80s I was busy learning to walk, talk and digest solid food), so I don&amp;rsquo;t have any nostalgia for them, but some are still around and some are around again, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d have a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first thought was, I want the authentic experience, so I&amp;rsquo;ll try it on real hardware! I still have my dads old C64 here, but I don&amp;rsquo;t have a modem for it, so that idea was scrapped immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, how about BMC64 on a Raspberry Pi? I tried it before and it felt like a pretty authentic C64 experience (esp. on a Raspi 400), but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have network drivers, so no luck there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C64 mini maybe? But again, it can&amp;rsquo;t access the net. Next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raspberry Pi with an emulator? I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like going thorugh the trouble of downloading an image and setting everything up, so nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, Vice emulator on my PC. Here I cheated because I used my regular computer, not the slow one, because running emulation on it might have been too much to ask of it. But after downloading the emulator and googling around for a suitable terminal software I realized that the process of getting it running might be a bit more involved than I anticipated, and I really didn&amp;rsquo;t have the patience, so I abandoned that too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So eventually I settled on downloading syncterm, which can emulate all kinds of old terminals, including the C64s, and finally I could google the addresses of some BBSs and see what it was like back 40 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I realized pretty quickly that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t my cup of tea. While it was interesting to see how much love went into some of these boards, I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t really get into them. Maybe on authentic hardware and an old CRT it will be a better experience, but looking at huge ugly fonts on a modern laptop display just didn&amp;rsquo;t feel good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BBC from The Old Net even has the capability to open modern websites on it, so I tried a few, but again, the font is huge and ugly and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy to read&amp;hellip; I think for me this is missing the nostalgia factor that makes the experience special. But without the rose-tinted glasses on it felt a bit too old-school for my taste. My nostalgia for C64 and Amiga lies in the games, and my experiences with the online world began towards the end of the 90s, so that&amp;rsquo;s what feels nostalgic for me and what I enjoy revisiting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, it was an interesting experience and I learned something in the process, if only about myself ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;day-7&#34;&gt;Day 7&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this day is even shorter to wrap up, because I was at a family gathering all day and didn&amp;rsquo;t use my computer much at all. I only had my phone with my and did my best to stick to my rules of only using it for communication, but I may have accidentally opened the browser once or twice&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And with that the Old Computer Challenge is coming to an end!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fun, frustrating and enlightening at various times! The best thing was by far the community on the fediverse, IRC and reading all the blog entries and experiences of the other participants! I can&amp;rsquo;t wait what @solene has in store for us next year and I will definitely participate again and try to keep in touch with some of the people I met along the way. And for that alone the experience was worth it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will summarize my thoughts in a few days, so there will be one more post, but for now I&amp;rsquo;m relieved to have a computer that feels fast again to work with ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 4</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-4/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Jul 2023 08:50:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-4/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to take this post to get out some thoughts about the internet, social media and mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How is this related to the OldComputerChallenge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the longest time now I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a facebook profile, and I never had a twitter profile or a tiktok account or a profile on any of the new social media platforms that are en vogue these days. The only social media I had left was Instagram, but I stopped using it a few months ago because I realized I was just mindlessly scrolling through posts for hours on end without getting much value or enjoyment out of it at all. Which is exactly what the platform wants me to do of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s also the exact opposite of what &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; want to do. So I ditched it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I was better off for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But because I still keep an eye out on what&amp;rsquo;s new and exciting in internetland (Neuland, as our head of state famously called it a few years ago), I was intrigued by mastodon and the fediverse and the idea of having my own blog and not being at the mercy of an eccentric billionaire who could turn my profile off at any moment with no way for me to ever get it back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I got an account on mastodon. And started following a few people, and a few hashtags, and discovered the OldComputerChallenge. And that there was a whole community of people hosting their own blogs on simple webservers, using gopher or gemini, chatting on IRC and basically using the internet like it was 1999 (or so). So that intrigued me, and I decided to do the OldComputerChallenge as well, and blog about it and be in touch with the other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then something interesting happened. The first few days I tried to keep up with all the blogs, keep up with IRC, follow all the retrocomputing-related tags on mastodon, write my own posts and do all that while working in a slow OS with unfamiliar tools and workflows&amp;hellip; and I got stressed. A lot. I tried to do too many things, keep up with too many posts, flip back and forth between different tools and programs and communication channels, write my own stuff and do it all at the same time. Bad idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me two days to realize that this is really stressful, unhealthy and (most embarrassing to admit) completely unnecessary. Nobody cares if I don&amp;rsquo;t show up on IRC. Nobody cares if I read their post a day later, or not at all because I missed it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to be omnipresent and get all the information as quickly as possible, read all the articles, follow all the hashtags, answer all the posts etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s okay to disconnect. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to only show up on IRC occasionally. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to only scroll through mastodon once or twice a day. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to not read people&amp;rsquo;s posts if I don&amp;rsquo;t have the time or the energy. It&amp;rsquo;s okay to miss out on some conversations, posts, articles, videos, podcasts and whatever else is out there. And it&amp;rsquo;s also okay to post my own stuff not when I think I have to, but when it&amp;rsquo;s ready.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ironic that by slowing down my computer I sped up my brain to the point where it wasn&amp;rsquo;t good for me anymore, before I realized that the slow approach also works (and works well) in other areas of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, of course I went through this cycle many, many times before, and the solution is always the same: notice it, take a deep breath, then change it. But occasionally a reminder to slow down and take a step back is needed, and this challenge certainly served as one :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 3</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:50:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On this day I was sick, so not a lot has happened, but I would like to still briefly share a few thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m spending far less time aimlessly surfing the web or watching youtube-videos for hours on end, simply because it&amp;rsquo;s not very much fun. Surfing works, but most sites are not very pleasant to look at or don&amp;rsquo;t work at all in a minimalist browser (think lynx, links2, luakit) or they slow the computer down to a crawl when using vivaldi (which is already slow thanks to its significant memory footprint). Important lesson: don&amp;rsquo;t have more than one or two tabs open at once. Just don&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And watching youtube is pretty much impossible. Even just loading the start page takes forever, and trying to load a video&amp;hellip; just no. I had downloaded yt-dlp beforehand to be able to download yt-videos at a lower resolution, but I would still have to get the url from somewhere and honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t even miss it. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll eventually catch up on a few interesting videos that I missed during the week, but right now I&amp;rsquo;m completely fine without spending the evening on my couch aimlessly browsing youtube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A win in my opinion!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fun I fired up a VM (one core slowed down, 512mb RAM of course) with Windows XP and browsed some old sites via &lt;a href=&#34;https://theoldnet.com&#34;&gt;the old net&lt;/a&gt; using Retrozilla, and that turned out to be a surprising amount of fun! Retrozilla is also able to access gopher sites, and since most of the OCC-participants who run blogs keep them very minimal, starting at &lt;a href=&#34;https://occ.deadnet.se&#34;&gt;occ.deadnet.se&lt;/a&gt; and looking through the blog entries listed there was no problem at all. And &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; faster than doing the same thing on a modern linux, despite a minimalist window manager and a lightweight browser (Midori). I even managed to install an old version of mIRC and join #oldcomputerchallenge on libera.chat, which was very surprising but pretty awesome and gave me a huge nostalgia hit :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Putty still works on XP as well, so I can ssh into my &amp;ldquo;server&amp;rdquo; (a raspberry pi really) and do linux-y stuff on there. All in all a surprisingly nice and nostalgic experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I also switched my window manager from i3 to herbstluftwm. Why? First, I had already used herbstluftwm before and am familiar with how it works, and second, I like the name :) (for the non-German speaking world, &amp;ldquo;Herbstluft&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;autumn air&amp;rdquo;, which I think is just beautiful. Once I figure out how to post audio on here, I&amp;rsquo;ll put a file online with the correct pronounciation ;) )&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 2</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Jul 2023 18:00:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Day 2 is coming to a close. Today I was at work all day and so didn&amp;rsquo;t spend a whole lot of time on my slow computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, A thought occurred to me recently, because since I subscribed to mastodon a couple of weeks ago and especially since I started following some retro computing related postings (where I discoved the OCC in the first place), I discovered that there&amp;rsquo;s a thing called&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://communitywiki.org/static/SmolNet.html&#34;&gt;The SmolNet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So what is it? Well, according to the link above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The âsmolâ net is the âsmallâ net. Itâs small because it is build for friends and friends of friends. It doesnât have to scale to millions of people because those millions should build their own local small nets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does this help explaining it? No?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, if you&amp;rsquo;re in or approaching middle age right now, you probably remember the internet of the 90s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re too young for that, this might sound like grandpa telling stories about the war, but there was a time when the internet was young and it wasn&amp;rsquo;t yet entirely run by a handful of gigantic evil megacorporations (Amazon, Google, Facebook&amp;hellip;). Back then, people used to meet and chat on forums or IRC or BBSes (bulletin boards, but that was even before my time), and they would code their own personal websites and build communities and exchange their thoughts and ideas in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then came the web 2.0 with Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram etc., which opened the web up to the masses, but it also ushered in an era where everyone was on the same few platforms and where everyone&amp;rsquo;s profile looks like everyone elses because that was what the platform dictated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;strong&gt;The Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt; was introduced and turned the internet into a miserable and dystopian hellscape filled with online bullying and hatred and outrage because that&amp;rsquo;s what gets peoples attention and is good for the bank accounts of the Zuckerbergs and Dorseys and Musks of the world, but bad for essentially the rest of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;rsquo;s where we&amp;rsquo;re still at today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In between the cracks of this modern, corporatized, &lt;a href=&#34;https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/21/potemkin-ai/#hey-guys&#34;&gt;enshittified&lt;/a&gt; internet where everything looks the same and everyone is out to get your data and track you and bombard you with ads there is a small world where the internet of old still (or again?) exists. Where people build small websites, talk on IRC or BBSes, and use old protocols like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)&#34;&gt;gopher&lt;/a&gt; (or modernized versions like &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemini_(protocol)&#34;&gt;gemini&lt;/a&gt;) and exchange information in this way, far away from the walled gardens of Facebook, Twitter and such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like it was when the internet was new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The internet of old is still alive today. You just have to look in the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think this is beautiful, and it makes me happy, and I&amp;rsquo;m glad I discovered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s explore it some more on day 3 :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Day 1</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-1/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jul 2023 09:46:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-day-1/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, Day 1 is almost over, what have we learned?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern software sucks!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really, a lot of it is quite beautiful and easy to use, but boy, everything consumes so many resources! Just starting up a web browser (firefox or chrome doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter) takes a good ten seconds or more, and then we haven&amp;rsquo;t even loaded a single page yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And webpages are also so slow and bloated these days! I haven&amp;rsquo;t limited my bandwidth thankfully (otherwise I&amp;rsquo;d go completely crazy), but just trying to open any normal page I can watch the CPU hang at 100% load for 10, 20, 30 seconds even, and the memory consumption goes up and up and up&amp;hellip;. For comparison I installed Windows XP in a VM with the exact same settings as my modern linux (1 core, limited to 50%, 512mb RAM) and it runs! Installed retrozilla browser, and that is lightning fast as well (though not terribly useful any more because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t render modern sites very well&amp;hellip;. and let&amp;rsquo;s not even think about security). This just shows how much more resource-hungry everything has become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, sidenote: I noticed that this site here doesn&amp;rsquo;t render very well on old browsers either, and on links2 (console-based browser) it isn&amp;rsquo;t useable at all because the links to the posts are not accessible. Ups&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t know enough HTML to fix this though, so this is a problem for future me. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll have it sorted for the next OCC in a year ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About sites like YouTube&amp;hellip; yeah, best not to talk about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Listening to a podcast was fine though, I downloaded it through gpodder, copied it to my iPod and enjoyed it free of distraction on my couch :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plans for the upcoming days:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out more console based alternatives to the software I normally use (browser, podcatcher, mastodon-client, mail-client etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dive a bit more into Windows XP, if for nothing more than nostalgia&amp;rsquo;s sake&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try not to go crazy with everything being so slow! :P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Old Computer Challenge - Preparation</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-preparation/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Jul 2023 09:46:48 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://82mhz.net/posts/2023/07/old-computer-challenge-preparation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year I learned about &lt;a href=&#34;https://bsd.network/@solene&#34;&gt;Solene&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://dataswamp.org/~solene/2023-06-04-old-computer-challenge-v3.html&#34;&gt;Old Computer Challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought hey, I might give it a go!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this year the rules for the challenge are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s use a SLOW computer for 7 days. This will be achieved by various means with any hardware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit your computer&amp;rsquo;s CPU to use only 1 core. This can be set in the BIOS most of the time, and on Linux you can use &lt;code&gt;maxcores=1&lt;/code&gt; in the boot command line, on OpenBSD you can use &lt;code&gt;bsd.sp&lt;/code&gt; kernel for the duration of the challenge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Limit your computer&amp;rsquo;s memory to 512 MB of memory (no swap limit). This can be set on Linux using the boot command line &lt;code&gt;mem=512MB&lt;/code&gt;. On OpenBSD, this can be achieved a bit similarly by using &lt;code&gt;datasize-max=512M&lt;/code&gt; in login.conf for your user&amp;rsquo;s login class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set your CPU frequency to the lowest minimum (which is pretty low on modern hardware!). On Linux, use the &amp;ldquo;powersave&amp;rdquo; frequency governor, in modern desktop environments the battery widget should offer an easy way to set the governor. On OpenBSD, run &lt;code&gt;apm -L&lt;/code&gt; (while apmd service is running). On Windows, in the power settings, set the frequency to minimum.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, easy enough, right? Well, of course my natural tendency to overthink everything kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First I thought, I&amp;rsquo;d fire up my (almost) 20 year old laptop from back when I was in university. Turns out, the thing is really on its last legs, the battery has died long ago, the display hinges are barely holding together, the backlight (CFL, no LEDs) could give up at any moment&amp;hellip; not a pleasant experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://82mhz.net/aspire2001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Acer Aspire 2001&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d just slow down my normal desktop PC to one core, 512mb RAM and limit the cpu frequency&amp;hellip; but that didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel old, it was just my normal computer a bit slower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So after a lot of thinking what I ended up with is this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep my desktop computer off for the week&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use only my Laptop (a 2013 (or 2014?) 13 inch Macbook Air, almost old and vintage itself!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a VM in Virtualbox with 512mb RAM, one cpu core and limit the core to 50% speed (I have no idea how slow this actually is compared to a proper old computer, but it does feel slow, and that&amp;rsquo;s the point, right?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install Endeavouros (an Arch Linux variant) with the i3 window manager and use mostly terminal apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For fun, I also installed a second VM (same specs as above) with Windows XP for that authentic retro-feeling (I used it back in the day before I switched to Linux in 2008 or so)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate browsing and YouTube on my smartphone (because otherwise I would just use this all week) and only use the phone as a communication device, meaning only for SMS, WhatsApp, E-Mail and (shocker!) even as a proper telephone!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Music comes from physical media, meaning CDs, vinyl, radio or an old iPod (yes, I&amp;rsquo;m lumping the iPod in with the physical media because it&amp;rsquo;s a dedicated device whose only purpose is to play music - and most importantly it can&amp;rsquo;t go online!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is the setup for now, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how the week goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://82mhz.net/oldComputerSetup.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Setup for the OldComputerChallenge&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the fun begin!&lt;/p&gt;
