      <title>More Context for Links</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a post by &lt;a href=&#34;https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/giving-context-to-a-blogroll/&#34;&gt;Simone on his Minutes to Midnight blog&lt;/a&gt;, which to my horror I discovered is already three months old (it felt more like three weeks to me), I decided to add a few words of description to the blogs I have linked on my links page. It&amp;rsquo;s a work in progress, and I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely happy yet with all the descriptions I wrote, but it&amp;rsquo;s a start.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Different RSS feeds for Posts and Thoughts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought about whether I should have one RSS feed for everything on the site or separate feeds for posts (longer articles) and thoughts (shorter ones). After getting some feedback and also thinking about it for a bit, I decided to have separate RSS feeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now there&amp;rsquo;s two feeds for the site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://82mhz.net/index.xml&#34;&gt;https://82mhz.net/index.xml&lt;/a&gt; for longer posts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://82mhz.net/thoughts/index.xml&#34;&gt;https://82mhz.net/thoughts/index.xml&lt;/a&gt; for shorter thoughts and notes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Dark Mode</title>
      <link>https://82mhz.net/thoughts/dark-mode/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I implemented a (pretty rudimentary) dark mode for the website. It&amp;rsquo;s set to follow the operating system preferences for light or dark mode. I considered adding a switch to the website to toggle between light and dark, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know if this is really necessary&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback is of course welcome, as well as bug reports if something isn&amp;rsquo;t working right.&lt;/p&gt;
