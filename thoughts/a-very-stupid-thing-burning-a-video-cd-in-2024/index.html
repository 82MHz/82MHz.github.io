            <p>A while ago <a href="https://fosstodon.org/@jhx">jhx</a> and I hijacked a <a href="https://bsd.network/@solene/112377539689945573">mastodon post by Solene</a> (sorry ;) ) and started talking about Video CDs. Because, you know, why not. And I was wondering, if I compressed a movie from 4K down to Video CD resolution and burned it on a CD, would my DVD player be able to play it? And how would it look?</p>
<p>Do you ever find yourself thinking &ldquo;that would be a pretty useless and stupid thing to do&rdquo;, and then you go and do it?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; to answer my initial questions right away: Yes, it works. And yes, it looks terrible :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to write up a detailed tutorial on how to do this, because I don&rsquo;t think anyone would actually try for real, but here&rsquo;s the steps I took (and I&rsquo;ll put links to some resources at the bottom):</p>
<ol>
<li>First I had to compress the movie down to a lower resolution and mpeg-2 audio and video codec. I did this with ffmpeg.</li>
<li>Next I installed TMPGEnc Plus together with some Video CD templates in a Windows XP virtual machine. This program can not read modern audio/video codecs, which is why the previous step was necessary.</li>
<li>I opened the mpeg-2 video file in TMPGEnc Plus and selected an appropriate template with a gigantic resolution of 352x288 pixels for the output video file, set a few other options about quality and file size and let it do its thing.</li>
<li>Once this was finished, I opened a CD burning program that can burn Video CDs (I used k3b on Linux), loaded the file that TMPGEnc Plus created and burned the CD.</li>
<li>I put the CD in my DVD Player, pressed play&hellip; and <strong>YOU WON&rsquo;T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT!!!</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Actually, you probably will, because I already told you. It worked, just like that. The player recognized the CD as a Video CD and started playing it without a hitch. I was actually really surprised, I hadn&rsquo;t expected it to just work first try! But I guess sometimes you&rsquo;re lucky and things just work.</p>
<p>So how does it look? Well, not great of course. It&rsquo;s blocky, it&rsquo;s blurry, there&rsquo;s lots of color banding going on, and I set the wrong aspect ratio somewhere along the way, so the image is squashed together and distorted&hellip; In short, it looks as if it was downloaded from the internet in the late 90s. Glorious!</p>
<p>Here it is playing on my TV:</p>
<img class="image" src="/images/vcd/matrix1.jpg" style="width:70%; height:auto;"/>
<br>
<img class="image" src="/images/vcd/matrix2.jpg" style="width:70%; height:auto;"/>
<p>I must say though that the quality is not as bad as I had anticipated, given the resolution and the file size (and the codec!). On my tiny 14&rsquo;&rsquo; CRT TV I had in my bedroom back in the day it would have probably been fine and not looked much different in terms of quality than a VHS tape.</p>
<p>But just to get a sense of the difference in terms of quality, here is the VCD version next to the Full HD (1080p) version:</p>
<img class="image" src="/images/vcd/matrix3.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"/>
<p>And here at roughly the same size:</p>
<img class="image" src="/images/vcd/matrix4.jpg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"/>
<p>4k of course is even bigger, but my screen isn&rsquo;t big enough to show a full 4k window ;)</p>
<p>As a sidenote, one of the first movies I got as a pirated digital copy before the official DVD release from a friend in school was The Matrix, so as a flashback to this, that&rsquo;s the movie I chose to burn on the VCD. The quality of that copy back then was even worse than what I created here, because if I recall correctly it was filmed off a cinema screen&hellip;</p>
<p>So would I recommend you do this? Absolutely not of course! But it was fun figuring this out, and seeing that my DVD player actually played the CD was still very satisfying.</p>
