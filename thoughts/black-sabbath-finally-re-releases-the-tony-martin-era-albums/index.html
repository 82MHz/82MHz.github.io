            <p>Most people are at least somewhat familiar with Black Sabbath because of the popularity of Ozzy Osbourne, but fewer people know that they had a decades long career with about a million lineup changes and a lot of different singers in the 80s and 90s.</p>
<p>The most famous one is of course Ronnie James Dio, but one singer hardly anyone is familiar with is Tony Martin, who recorded a few albums with Sabbath in the late 80s/early 90s, which are in my opinion incredibly overlooked and underrated. The albums were The Eternal Idol, Headless Cross, Tyr, Cross Purposes and Forbidden, and especially Headless Cross and Tyr are two of my favourite Sabbath albums, if not some my favourite metal albums of all time, period.</p>
<p>They haven&rsquo;t been available on Spotify or on CD for a long time, but now finally they&rsquo;re being reissued in form of a remastered box set, and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier to finally see these albums being given the respect and love they deserve.</p>
<p>If you are a Sabbath fan, but don&rsquo;t know this era of the band, I highly recommend checking it out. It&rsquo;s completely different from the Ozzy material, more similar to the Ronnie James Dio albums with a heavy 80s touch (with lots and lots of reverb!), which means great epic songs and simply fantastic vocals. I can&rsquo;t recommend these albums enough, I hope you&rsquo;ll give them a listen!</p>
