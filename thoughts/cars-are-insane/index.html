            <p><a href="https://www.adamsdesk.com/">Adamsdesk</a> posted an article yesterday titled <a href="https://www.adamsdesk.com/posts/life-without-car/">&ldquo;Living Life Without Owning A Car&rdquo;</a>. And my immediate thought was &ldquo;yes - because cars are insane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why do I think that? Well first of all, if you&rsquo;re using a car because you have to move heavy construction equipment around or you take your whole family to visit Grandma on a Sunday afternoon, that&rsquo;s fine. I have no issue with that.</p>
<p>But most people use their cars primarily to drive themselves around, and nothing else. Maybe their purse.</p>
<p>A typical car that someone like me without a family might buy would be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf">Volkswagen Golf</a> or something similiar (of course I had to pick a German brand, and Golf has been one of the most popular cars for literally decades at this point in Germany).</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_Golf_Mk8">A quick look at Wikipedia</a> tells me that this car in its bare minimum base configuration weighs 1255kg. My current weight is around 80kg.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s do a bit of math here. If we take the numbers above, we can calculate that my weight is around 6,4% of the weight of the car (80kg/1255kg * 100), or put the other way round, this (small) car weighs almost 16 times as much as I do (1255kg/80kg).</p>
<p>In other words, If I get in this car to drive somewhere, more than 93% of the total mass that gets moved around is <em>the car</em>! And of course 93% of the energy that gets used for this (in the form of gasoline) is used to move <em>the car</em> around, not me. It&rsquo;s not me who&rsquo;s moving from place A to B and back, it&rsquo;s a gigantic pile of glass and plastic and metal, and I&rsquo;m just kind of along for the ride.</p>
<p>And keep in mind, these are calculations for a <strong>small</strong> car. If we get into the territory of sports cars, SUVs or Pickup Trucks, which are easily twice as heavy as a Golf, the numbers get even crazier. And we could do the same calculation for how much room a car takes up vs. how much room a person takes up and arrive at similar results.</p>
<p>And I haven&rsquo;t even started talking about the fact that almost all public space available outside (in the city at least) is reserved for cars <strong>of course</strong>, and cars everywhere are parked on the sidewalk <strong>of course</strong>, because where else would you park your car? On the street? Don&rsquo;t be ridiculous, that would block the way for other cars. Can&rsquo;t have that!</p>
<p>Thinking about it, maybe my headline is not entirely correct. Maybe it&rsquo;s not the cars that are insane. Maybe it&rsquo;s our relationship with them.</p>
