            <p>This is a bit of a nerdy technobubble thing, and you might not know the people involved or care about them, but please bear with me, there&rsquo;s a point I want to make.</p>
<p>So last week a Youtuber named <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ChrisTitusTech">Chris Titus</a>, who makes mostly videos about all things related to Linux, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_uqTouv6LA">posted a video in which he criticised Bryan Lunduke</a>. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BryanLunduke">Bryan Lunduke</a> is a tech journalist I guess, he used to work for Suse and is quite well known in Linux circles, though apparently also very controversial because his political content has drifted to the right in recent of years. I was aware of him a couple of years ago, but he dropped off my radar long ago, so I had no idea what he was doing or that he became controversial.</p>
<p>Anyway, so Titus made a video where he voiced some criticism about Lunduke&rsquo;s political content, but also spoke very favorably about his more tech related content.</p>
<p>As a response, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6IW6bJX0j0">Lunduke invited him onto his channel</a> to have a conversation about the video.</p>
<p>And this is the thing I want to highlight. Titus made a critical video about Lunduke, but rather than now Lunduke making a video response directed at Titus and the whole thing blowing up and getting out of control and turning into a huge shit show where everyone is just throwing shit at the other person, they sat down together, had a conversation and talked about their disagreements. And they agreed on some things, disgreed on other things, but they also clearly respect each other and at no point did the conversation devolve into name-calling, shouting the other person down, threatening them or any of the other things we see so often in online discussions nowadays.</p>
<p>It was just a conversation between two people with different politics, discussing their differences of opinion, sometimes reaching common ground, sometimes not, all while being civil and respectful towards one another and parting amicably with the promise to &ldquo;grab a cheeseburger together&rdquo; the next time their paths cross.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s how I feel disagreements between grown up people should be handled. Talk it out, if you find common ground that&rsquo;s great, if you don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s still fine, you can agree to disagree and still not spew virtriol and hate at the other person.</p>
