            <p>Yesterday I wrote about using an image from Playboy as a test image for testing image compression algorithms, and that reminded me of another anecdote from university where a piece of popular media was used in the development of a new technology.</p>
<p>I studied at the University Erlangen-Nürnberg in Germany, which is closely connected to the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits in Erlangen, where the mp3 file format was developed in the 80s and 90s. I also used to work there during and after University for a while, but not at the Audio department.</p>
<p>Anyway, many of the mp3 developers were still working at Fraunhofer when I studied there, and I had a few classes about audio signal processing with them. And they used to tell the story where they would test the quality of the compression by listening to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mto47BMT3yA">&ldquo;Toms Diner&rdquo; by Suzanne Vega</a> over and over again, because the original version of the song (not the DNA remix) is purely a capella, vocals only and nothing else.</p>
<p>Because our ears are very finely tuned to recognizing human voices and spotting even the tiniest nuances and fluctuations in the sound of a voice, this song was the perfect candidate to test the compression algorithm on, since every tiny bit of distortion or compression artifact would stand out and be immediately noticeable.</p>
<p>And so, just like Lena Forsén was instrumental in developing the jpeg image format, Suzanne Vega was instrumental in developing the mp3 audio format.</p>
<hr>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no such story about the development of video compression algorithms, at least not that I remember, so there won&rsquo;t be a part three in this mini series.</p>
<p>This anecdote is also <a href="https://observer.com/2008/09/suzanne-vega-is-the-mother-of-the-mp3/">well documented online</a>, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure I heard about it first in a university lecture about mp3.</p>
